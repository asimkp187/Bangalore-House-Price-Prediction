# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
  Machine learning project to predict Bangalore house prices using Linear Regression, with 85% accuracy after data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal

📌 Overview

  This project analyzes employee salary data and predicts salary based on years of experience. The dataset contained 6,700+ employee records with demographic and job-related details. 
  Using Linear Regression, the model explored the relationship between experience and salary.

📂 Dataset

  • 6,704 employee records (age, gender, education, job title, experience, salary)

  • Cleaned dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies

🔑 Objectives

  • Explore the relationship between experience and salary

  • Perform EDA on demographics and job categories

  • Train a Linear Regression model for salary prediction

  • Evaluate performance with R², MAE, and MSE metrics

🛠️ Steps Performed

  • Data Cleaning (removed missing/inconsistent values)

  • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with correlation heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots

  • Model Training using Linear Regression

  • Performance Evaluation with R² = 0.67, MAE, and MSE

📈 Results & Insights

  • Salary strongly correlates with years of experience

  • Educational level and job title also show significant influence

  • Gender-based salary distribution highlighted in EDA

🚀 Future Work

  • Add more predictors (education level, job title) using one-hot encoding
  • Experiment with ensemble methods for better accuracy
  • Build a dashboard to visualize salary insights interactively

💻 Technologies Used

  • Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

  • Jupyter Notebook for analysis
