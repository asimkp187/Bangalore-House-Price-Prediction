# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction

  Machine learning project to predict Bangalore house prices using Linear Regression, with 85% accuracy after data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal
  
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

  This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and building a predictive model to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project is Bengaluru_House_Data.csv, which contains 13,320 entries with the following features:

â€¢ area_type: Type of area (e.g., Super built-up, Plot, Built-up)

â€¢ availability: Availability status of the property

â€¢ location: Neighborhood location

â€¢ size: Number of bedrooms (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK)

â€¢ society: Housing society name

â€¢ total_sqft: Total square footage

â€¢ bath: Number of bathrooms

â€¢ balcony: Number of balconies

â€¢ price: Price of the property (in lakhs)

â¦¾ Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning

â€¢ Removed unnecessary columns (area_type, society, balcony, availability).

â€¢ Handled missing values by dropping rows with null entries.

â€¢ Extracted the number of bedrooms (bhk) from the size column.

â€¢ Cleaned the total_sqft column by converting ranges (e.g., "1000-1500") to average values.

2. Feature Engineering

â€¢ Created a new feature price_per_sqft to analyze the relationship between price and square footage.

â€¢ Grouped less frequent locations under the "other" category to reduce dimensionality.

3. Outlier Detection and Removal

â€¢ Removed properties where the square footage per bedroom was less than 300 sq ft.

â€¢ Applied statistical methods to remove outliers in the price_per_sqft feature based on standard deviation.

4. Data Visualization

â€¢ Used scatter plots to visualize the relationship between square footage and price for different bedroom configurations (e.g., 2 BHK vs. 3 BHK).

â¦¾ Key Insights

â€¢ The dataset initially contained 13,320 entries, which was reduced to 10,222 after cleaning and outlier removal.

â€¢ Properties with unusually low square footage per bedroom were identified and removed.

â€¢ The price_per_sqft feature was normalized to reduce the impact of extreme values.

â¦¾ Tools and Libraries

â€¢ Python: Primary programming language

â€¢ Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

â€¢ NumPy: Numerical computations

â€¢ Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

ðŸ”® Next Steps

â€¢ Implement machine learning models for price prediction

â€¢ Perform model tuning and validation

â€¢ Develop web application for real-time predictions

â€¢ Expand analysis to other Indian cities
